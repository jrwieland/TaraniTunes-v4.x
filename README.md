## TaraniTunes v4.4 Edge(color radios) v4.3(color OpenTX) and v4.0 (non-color radios)
  
**Awesome music player for OpenTX based radios. or any radio capable of running a lua script**  
*Originally this started as a separate advanced fork from the Original TaraniTunes developed by [GilDev](https://github.com/GilDev).     
GilDev and I agreed that both versions of the script (the original and this advanced version) would be available for users but hosted separately.*
